# Evaluations
A part of the contribution of this package is standardizing the evaluations of MDP-based GR frameworks.
This sub-package provides scripts to analyze the results of the all_experiments.py execution, done over the ODGR problems defined at consts.py.

The repository provides benchmark domains and scripts for analyzing experimental results. The `evaluation` directory contains tools for processing and visualizing the results from odgr_executor.py and all_experiments.py.

## The evaluation scripts will be added and supported in the future.
