### GRAML ###
## Setup:
1. Ensure you have python 3.11 installed.
If you have root permissions, simply use:
```
mkdir -p ~/.local/python3.11
dnf install python3.11 --prefix ~/.local/python3.11
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.local/python3.11/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
Else, use pyenv:
```
pyenv install 3.11.0
```
2. Create a new venv or use an existing 3.11 venv, and activate it. To create a new venv:
```
~/.pyenv/versions/3.11.0/bin/python -m venv graml_env
./Python-3.11.0/graml_env/bin/activate
```
If you're not a sudo, and you have problems with building python getting such warnings:
```
WARNING: The Python ctypes extension was not compiled. Missing the libffi lib?
```
That means you don't have the necesarry libraries for building python, and you probably can't change that since you're not a sudoer.
An alternative solution can be using a conda env:
```
conda create -n graml_env python=3.11
conda activate graml_env
```
3. Install GoalRecognitionLibs to get all needed dependencies:
```
git clone [GoalRecognitionLibs address]
cd GoalRecognitionLibs
pip install -e . # using the conda's pip of course
```

## Execution:
# First, generate the results by running the framework with the experiments:
1. GRAML - python graml_main.py graml continuing_partial_obs inference_same_length learn_same_length collect_statistics
2. GRAQL - python graml_main.py graql fragmented_partial_obs collect_statistics
# Second, run the script that generates the results in a report plot:
1. GRAML - python scripts/generate_statistics_plots.py graml MiniGrid-Walls-13x13-v0/fragmented_partial_obs/inference_same_length/learn_same_length
2. GRAQL - python scripts/generate_statistics_plots.py graql MiniGrid-Walls-13x13-v0/fragmented_partial_obs

### GRAML - goals adaptation phase issues
If you see the plan generated by the MCTS planner isn't optimal, it needs more rollouts. Go to graml_recognizer.py and change the number of rollouts it decides when it calls 'plan' of mcts_planner.py.
